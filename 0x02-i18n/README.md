i18n stands for "internationalization," a term used in the software development and localization industry. It is derived from the word "internationalization," where "i" represents the first letter, followed by 18 characters, and "n" represents the last letter.

Internationalization is the process of designing and developing software applications in a way that allows them to be easily adapted to different languages, regions, and cultures without requiring major code changes. The goal is to make the application more accessible and user-friendly to a global audience.

The main components of internationalization include:

Text and Message Translation: All user-visible text, such as labels, buttons, and error messages, is externalized into resource files, making it easier to translate into various languages.

Date and Time Formats: Handling date and time formats in a locale-aware manner to match the conventions of different regions.

Number Formats: Formatting numbers, decimals, and currencies according to regional standards.

Support for Multiple Character Encodings: Ensuring the application can handle various character encodings used in different languages.

User Interface Layout: Adapting the layout of the user interface to accommodate text expansion and contraction in different languages.

Cultural Adaptation: Considering differences in cultural norms and customs that may impact how the application functions.

By implementing internationalization correctly, developers can create a foundation that allows the application to be easily localized or translated into different languages and adapted for use in various countries and regions.

It is important to distinguish internationalization (i18n) from localization (L10n). While internationalization refers to the preparation of software for adaptation to different languages and cultures, localization refers to the actual process of translating and adapting the software to a specific language or region.
